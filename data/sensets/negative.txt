A car does not have a horn
A clown does not have a car
A beast is not a burden
The boat won't start
The spaceship can't travel to mars
Why can't this work well
This is not a good example
A rug does not make a good hat
Asphalt can't turn red
The sky isn't falling
The quad won't make it past the tree
The forest is not on fire
What is not a positive question
This can not be a thing
Please do not let that happen
The leaf doesn't make a tree
The grass hardly counts as a floor
That window does not tie the room together
That shirt does not look good on you
What can't you do
Why can't you do that
Can you not go there
Let's not do this in a bunch of fancy words
Sports are not fun to watch
Cher is most certainly not a good singer
This new generation of music is not good
Ford does not make a well-built car
That guy over there is not attractive
I do not want to write any more of these
My hands do not feel well
I can't think of too many more
Cats do not make good pets
Mailboxes do not make good friends
Windows is not fun to work with
Python is not a compiled language
Scripted code is not fast
That program can't do that
Won't you please give me one dollar
I can't afford it
I am not sorry for that
You do not deserve one dollar
Therefore you will not receive one dollar
Not from me anyway
You might not ever receive a dollar
Maybe you won't ever find a dollar
Then you can't afford a piece of gum
Gum doesn't fix bad attitudes
Verily you shall not pass
That test wasn't hard
This project was not easy
Floor does not have hardwood
Ceiling cannot have paint
Light can't shine
Toolboxes are not colorful
Tables hardly have texture
Microphones can hardly play music
Monitors can't speak
Flags can not howl at the moon
Four grapes are not better than two
I may not have the right answer
She may not have it either
He won't tell you what's going on
Mary did not have a little lamb
Joe can't spell well
James is not a good baseball player
Arthur may not come
Alyssa is not a mean person
John is hardly a good speller
Fritz is not a common name
Lilly does not have a shirt
Adam does not have a table
Keypads do not have letters
Sunsets are not unsightly
The car will not stop in time
Astrid won't have any part of it
Windows is not a good system
Linux is not a slow system
Linux does not have many viruses
Linus is not easy to use
A cord might not work
Donald may not work
Mickey does not have a watch
An alien might not come peacefully
War is not the answer
Lying can't help you now
Telling a lie is not an option
If our country does not lead the cause of freedom it will not be led
Wealth is not inimical to welfare
Abandonment and abuse are not acts of god they are failures of love
The present must not become the permanent condition of the government
The constitution did not make our democracy impotent
A modern navy can not be improvised
The flicker of hope didn't help
Street lamp do not care
Pixels do not have feelings
Lighthouses do not help Kansas
Speed limits do not work
Trucks are not pointless for workers
The people do not want another Bush
He may not continue
